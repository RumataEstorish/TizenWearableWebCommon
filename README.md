# Tizen Wearable Web Common
Tizen Wearable Web application common components

## Introduction
I've developed tizen apps since Gear 2.0. And now I want to share some of my code base, mostly common for my apps. If someone is still interested in Web apps coding (poor you), you can feel free to use this codes.

At this moment some codes are not documented and described and without samples. Please, be patient, or investigate them by youself.

Don't be rude - I hate javascript and if you want to support very old devices, you have to stay old javascript.

### Compatibility
All codes works from Gear 1 till Galaxy Watch Active 2 and later, so main purpose is backward compatibility.

### Base
Project built with rather old tizen libs, but they work stable (v0.13.29, it's libs from Gear S2 or Tizen 3.0. I don't remember). Also jquery requires. jquery-3.3.1 is ok. Every component can use Utils library, so it's important to download and include it either. If some code don't use it, next update I can rely on it either.

Don't forget to copy "style.css" to make it looks better (yes, Samsung didn't include all styles into their libraries)


## Valuable code
### ActionMenu
ActionMenu shows circular menu for circle devices and popup for rectangular.

### Circle-helper
Patch for Tizen circle-helper allows to force bezel rotation for element. Anyway not working with virtual-list

### CircleProgress
Small wrapper around progress bar

### ContextMenu
Different click events around item (probably list item). Supports click, click hold, long tap.

### SwipeList
Tiny wrapper around system swipe list

### ToastMessage
Tiny wrapper around system toast

### VirtualList
Patched system virtual list allowing dynamic content f.e. when you refresh data. Highly unrecommended to use it, works really bad especially when list item size is not the same

### Log
Tiny wrapper around console. Just like android log syntax

### SAP
Wrapper around samsung accessory protocol. Android part codes I will add later. Utilizes connection, reconnection, sending data etc

### GearHttp
Network utilization module. It sends web requests through XMLHttpRequest for devices newer then Gear 2.0, for Gear 2.0 it passthrough requests through Android phone. You can always force traffic through Android via flag (can be useful when ssl sertificates don't work with particular watch model). It also needs Android part of code I'll share later

### Utils
Different methods, which can be helpful

### Input
Draws input window and handles input from all watch generation. For Gear 1,2 it requires TypeGear app, for Gear S it draws rectangular window, for circle devices other shape :)

### Bonus
You can find lib/tau/wearable/theme/default/tau.circle-patch-0.0.0.1.min.cs which fixes circular menu icons bug, when they grow full screen. You know.
